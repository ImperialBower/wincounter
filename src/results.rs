    /// problem is, that `Rust` by default doesn't have mutable state so you don't need to be
    /// battening down the hatches all the time.
    ///
    /// With this refactoring I can take the same constructor and have all the state I need to
    /// calculate winning percentages.
    ///
    /// ## Second test
    ///
    /// OK, so we have `The Hand` in our `TestData` util. The problem is that it's got only two
    /// players. I want a three way hand just to kick the tires a little harder. I'm going to add
    /// a second hand from `S09E13` of High Stakes Poker between Daniel Negreanu, Patrik Antonius,
    /// and Phil Ivey where Daniel folded the best hand at the river because of a wild all in
    /// from Patrik Antonius. Daniel did a great
    /// [breakdown of the hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE3BP0KFqTA) on his channel.
    ///
    /// For now, I'm going to table this test. Let's get the code so that it works with The Hand
    /// before we get fancy.
